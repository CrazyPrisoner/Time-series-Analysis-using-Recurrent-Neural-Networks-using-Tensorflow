# Time-series-Analysis-using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks-using-Tensorflow

## Getting Started
We will be solving a simple problem where we are generating a sine wave and providing a batch of the sine wave to the RNN and asking it to predict the next value on the batch i.e. the value one time-step ahead. This is a really simple problem(this is a beginnerâ€™s tutorial) as we are only looking one time-step ahead, but the same implementation can be applied to predict data several time-steps ahead.

Recurrent neural networks can remember the state of an input from previous time-steps which helps it to take a decision for the future time-step. Watch the animation below carefully, and make sure you understand it.(Shoutout to iamtrask blog.)




## Requirements
 * Python 3.5 or above + pip
 * Tensorflow 1.6 or above
 * Pandas
 * Numpy
 * Scikit-learn
 * Matplotlib
 
 ## Running the model
 Install the required libraries and run this file.It will take about 20 seconds depending on your processor. 
 ```python
 python train.py
 ```

 ## Results
